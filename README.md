## how it works

### Section 0-3

SoMax Players are in "installation" mode, they influence each other continuously.

### Section 4

SoMax Players switch to "reactive" mode, only generating in response to human inputs.

### Section 5

SoMax back to installation mode, this time in a more chaotic / random configuration.
